* I've changed the .gitignore to ignore temporay editor files by adding the line:
*~

I didn't see any effect till I executed the following commands I've copied from a question posted on stackoverflow: 
First commit any outstanding code changes, and then, run this command:

git rm -r --cached .
This removes everything from the index, then just run:

git add .
Commit it:

git commit -m ".gitignore is now working"
---- 
hmm... I think there is still no effect
