this is just a test file to 
play a bit with git's branching

this is a change made in master  
and 
I added this from the testBranch 

thus, the merge conflict was resolved 

resolving the conflict between local repository and github's:

yet another change done locally in branch master 

ok, this change was made through github's web editor
