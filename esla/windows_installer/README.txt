In order to create the self extracted windows installation file 'esla_setup.exe', just run the batch file 'create_installer.bat'. 

This batch file activates two tools: py2exe and NSIS. py2exe is a tool to convert python scripts to windows executables and NSIS is a tool to pack executables to a self extracted installer (also takes care on the uninstaller)
